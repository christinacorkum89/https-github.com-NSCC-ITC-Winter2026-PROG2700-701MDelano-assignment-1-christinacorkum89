What I Learned:
Start simple, then add features

Clear console outputs help debugging

Multiple solutions can solve same problem

Performance matters with big data

ADHD-Friendly Tips I Used:
✅ One thing at a time - Each file does one job
✅ Clear console logs - I can see what's happening
✅ Visual feedback - Streaks show with brackets
✅ Error messages - Tell me exactly what went wrong

For Instructor:
All programs work! The simple versions are like fast food 🍔 - quick and gets the job done. The extra versions are like a fancy dinner 🍽️ - same food, but with presentation and extra courses.
